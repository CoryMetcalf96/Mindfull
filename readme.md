## Description
Mindfull is my first attempt at building a full CRUD application- four times over. This app allows you to create your own morning routine, night routine, to-do list, and journal. Beyond that- the CSS is completely vanilla in an effort to solidify CSS foundations.

I build applications and mini projects tied to my various interests. I look for creative solutions to real world problems and think of technical ways to address them. While no application is ever perfect I find joy in the process and all my final products!
